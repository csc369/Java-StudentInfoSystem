# Student-Information-System
This project was completed while doing a HTML, CSS, JSP/Servlet course.

The instructor gave no direction and I designed implemented the project while learning the above technologies.

I originally wrote the application using JSP/Servlets, JDBC, HTML, CSS, JSTL and mysql. 

Afterwards I thought myself Spring core and Spring MVC and Hibernate and I converted this project into a Spring MVC / Hibernate / Maven project.
